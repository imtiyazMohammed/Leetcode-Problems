​Algorithm:

    Merge the two given arrays into one array.
    Then sort the third(merged) array
    If the length of the third array is even then : divide the length of array by 2 return arr[value]  + arr[value – 1] / 2
    If the length of the third array is odd then: divide the length of the array by 2 round that value returns the arr[value]
